## Guidelines

### DO

- ✅ Keep the first line under 50 characters
- ✅ Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adds")
- ✅ Reference issue numbers: `🐛 bug: Fix login error (#123)`
- ✅ Be specific about what changed
- ✅ Add body for complex changes

### DON'T

- ❌ End the subject line with a period
- ❌ Use vague descriptions like "Fix bug" or "Update code"
- ❌ Mix multiple types in one commit
- ❌ Write overly long commit messages

## Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `BREAKING:` after the type:

```bash
🔥 feat: BREAKING: Change authentication to OAuth2

This changes the authentication flow from JWT to OAuth2.
All existing tokens will be invalidated.

Migration guide: docs/migration/oauth2.md
```

## Multi-line Commits

For complex changes, add a body:

```bash
🔥 feat: Add rate limiting to API endpoints

Implement rate limiting using express-rate-limit to prevent abuse.

Changes:
- 100 requests per 15 minutes for authenticated users
- 20 requests per 15 minutes for anonymous users
- Custom error messages for rate limit exceeded

Closes #456
Related: #123, #789
```

## Commit Message Template

You can set up a commit template by creating `.gitmessage`:

```
# <emoji> <type>: <description>

# Body (optional)
# |<---- Use 72 chars max per line ---->|

# Footer (optional)
# Closes #123
